/// iso_get_depth(isoy,layer)
///
/// Returns a depth value based on the units position in the room
/// Layer refers to the layer it will be drawn upon.
/// This can be used to draw objects in multiple views but beware!
/// It will use a huge number of depth values
/// Depthrange = room_height*isometric factor*layers
/// So for a room 1600 high with a iso factor of 0.5 and 3 layers of depth
/// This will result in 2400 depth values being used!
